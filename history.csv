PowerPoint Presentation and Pitch Deck Redesign Needed,"We are seeking an experienced designer to help us redesign our PowerPoint presentation and pitch deck to enhance visual appeal and effectiveness. Needs to incorporate suggestions below as well as provide cleaner, more appealing design - Let's start with the easy part - the Powerpoint. I like that it is crisp and concise. I would suggest you consider the following changes: � Drop the ""country"" designations. I am not sure of they are critical, but they are definitely distracting and a confusing detail for someone looking at this business model for the first time. � Consider simplifying the actors to: o Seller or Provider or Crypto Seller or Crypto Seller o Buyer or Customer o Crypto Broker o Capital Provider or Capital Partner � Slide 3 does not render well on a phone - background graphic makes text unreadable (fine on computer) � Most slides could use ""wordsmithing"" � I think there is an error on Slide 4 - In the first 2 steps, the ""USA seller"" transfers both cash and Crypto? This makes no sense. The first sub-transaction should be the Capital Provider moving cash to Escrow. � Slide 5 refers to a Swap Agreement. I don't know if you are using this term intentionally because it is a common term in the Crypto community, but a ""Swap Agreement"" in the rest of the financial world has a very different connotation - one that always includes a time frame. � Slide 5 also refers to an example that does not exist. � The Profit Margins page is very weak and should be the most attractive one for the ""Investor"". It should include some sort of Net Profits over time, preferably with growth. � Slide 7 - it is illegal (and definitely not recommended) for a fundraiser to provide tax advice. Too many variables. � Slide 8 - If this slide is supposed to highlight why to invest, it falls short by not emphasizing the ""magic"", or supporting any of the statements, which otherwise seems very generic. In addition to my previous comments, the slide the really describes the business is slide 4 (Transaction Process). I would recommend changes this slide in 2 ways: � Separate the ""happy path"" from the ""unhappy path"". Only discuss the ways things should work on slide 4 (No ""fails""). � Create another slide to highlight what can go wrong. This could be a duplicate of the current slide with just the fails, or it can be depicted as a Risk / Mitigation table. It's very important for investors to develop a comfort level by knowing that you have identified the risk points and that they understand the risks. Also gives you opportunity to add risk points without complicating the basic flow. When the basic flow is simple, people can wrap their minds around it much more easily. I like slide 8, but it seems disconnected from the rest of the presentation. I think the role / usage Escrow Account needs to be mentioned or even explained in other slides and then this slide would provide a much more meaningful summary. Consider moving it up close to Slide 4. In addition to my previous comments, the slide the really describes the business is slide 4 (Transaction Process).

I need this by end of day thursday (one day) so only bid if you can turnaround very quickly","Hi Joe! Can we enhance the clarity of your presentation by simplifying some content and restructuring key slides?
